The Project Proponent informed the Committee that the Plan envisages faster utilization of the fines from the fines dump by increasing operating hours of the fines beneficiation unit gradually from 5000 hrs to 6200 hrs per annum within a span of 3 years, which will increase the rate of reclamation of fines from the fine dump from 2.50 ΜΤΡΑ to 3.1 ΜΤPA and by reducing the mined out beneficiated ore feed to the beneficiation plant in order to increase reclaimed & beneficiated fines from the fines dump to the tune of 0.5 MTPA from 4th year onwards. The complete consumption of fines from the fine dump shall take about 9 years' time instead of 13 years envisaged earlier. The Committee accepted the Plan and recommended for utilization of fines as proposed by M/s SAIL within 9 years instead of 13-14 years. During this period, all pollution mitigation measures at the dump site shall be implemented and augmented with additional measures on the basis of any Specific Studies conducted through Reputed Institutions to prevent/minimize environmental impacts from the Fines Dumps.
